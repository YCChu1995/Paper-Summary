#### 1. FT Instability from BERT to T5 & GPT
The high generalization variance found in fine-tuning BERT, which leads to unstable fine-tuning from [ON THE STABILITY OF FINE-TUNING BERT: MISCONCEPTIONS, EXPLANATIONS, AND STRONG BASELINES](https://github.com/YCChu1995/Paper-Summary/blob/main/2006_On%20the%20Stability%20of%20Fine-tuning%20BERT%20-%20Misconceptions%2C%20Explanations%2C%20and%20Strong%20Baselines.md)
The high generalization variance is also found in T5 and GPT.
